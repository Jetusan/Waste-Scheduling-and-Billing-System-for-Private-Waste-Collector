# Admin Panel Fixes Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Collector Status Display Issue** ✅
**Problem:** Collectors showing "Inactive" in frontend even though database shows "Active"

**Root Cause:** 
- Backend API (`/api/collectors`) returns field name `employment_status`
- Frontend was looking for field name `status`
- Default fallback was set to 'inactive'

**Fix Applied:**
- **File:** `admin/src/pages/UserCollector.jsx` (line 203)
- **Change:** Updated mapping to check `employment_status` first: 
  ```javascript
  status: u.employment_status || u.status || 'inactive'
  ```

**Result:** Collector status now displays correctly from database

---

### 2. **Truck Addition Functionality** ✅
**Problem:** No POST endpoint existed for adding new trucks

**Root Cause:**
- Backend had GET, PUT, DELETE endpoints but missing POST
- Frontend was calling `POST /api/trucks` which returned 404

**Fix Applied:**
- **File:** `backend/routes/trucks.js` (lines 31-64)
- **Added:** Complete POST endpoint with:
  - Input validation (truck_number, plate_number required)
  - Database INSERT query
  - Proper response with created truck data
  - Error handling

**Result:** Admins can now add new trucks successfully

---

### 3. **Truck Update Functionality** ✅
**Problem:** Update endpoint was simulated, not actually updating database

**Fix Applied:**
- **File:** `backend/routes/trucks.js` (lines 66-92)
- **Changed:** From simulated response to actual database UPDATE
- **Added:** 
  - Real UPDATE query
  - 404 handling for non-existent trucks
  - Return updated truck data

**Result:** Truck updates now persist to database

---

### 4. **Truck Delete Functionality** ✅
**Problem:** Delete endpoint was simulated, not actually deleting from database

**Fix Applied:**
- **File:** `backend/routes/trucks.js` (lines 94-113)
- **Changed:** From simulated response to actual database DELETE
- **Added:**
  - Real DELETE query
  - 404 handling for non-existent trucks
  - Proper success response

**Result:** Truck deletions now work correctly

---

### 5. **Collection Schedule Actions** ✅
**Status:** Verified working correctly

**Checked:**
- Edit functionality (lines 143-174) - ✅ Working
- Delete functionality (lines 131-141) - ✅ Working
- Both have proper error handling and user feedback

**No changes needed** - already functioning properly
