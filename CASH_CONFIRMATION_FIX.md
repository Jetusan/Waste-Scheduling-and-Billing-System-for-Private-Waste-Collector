# Cash Confirmation Fix - Complete Flow

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **Issue 1: Amount Not Being Recorded**
**Problem:** When confirming cash payment, the amount wasn't being inserted into `collection_stop_events` table.

**Root Cause:** Cash confirmation only called `/api/billing/confirm-cash-payment` which:
- ✅ Activated subscription
- ✅ Recorded payment
- ❌ Did NOT record collection event with amount

**Solution:** Now calls BOTH endpoints:
1. `/api/billing/confirm-cash-payment` - Records payment & activates subscription
2. `/api/collector/assignments/stop/collected` - Records collection event WITH amount

---

### **Issue 2: Stop Not Disappearing**
**Problem:** After confirming cash, the stop remained visible in the collector's list.

**Root Cause:** The local state wasn't updated to mark the stop as "collected".

**Solution:** Added local state update:
```javascript
setStops(prev => prev.map(s => 
  s.user_id === stop.user_id 
    ? { ...s, latest_action: 'collected' }
    : s
));
```

This triggers the filter to hide the stop immediately.
