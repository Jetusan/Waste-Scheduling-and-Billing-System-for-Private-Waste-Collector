# Cash on Collection - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive cash payment tracking and risk mitigation system for your WSBS application. Here's what's now working:

---

## üéØ The Complete Flow

### **When User Subscribes with Cash on Collection:**

1. **User Side (Mobile App):**
   - User selects "Cash on Collection" payment method
   - Subscription created with status: `pending_payment`
   - Invoice generated with status: `unpaid`
   - User sees message: "Your subscription will be activated when you pay the collector during waste collection"

2. **Collector Side (During Waste Collection):**
   - Collector sees resident in their route
   - Payment method badge shows: "Cash on Collection"
   - Amount input field pre-filled with ‚Ç±199
   - Two options available:

   **Option A: Resident Pays Successfully**
   - Collector inputs amount (or uses default ‚Ç±199)
   - Clicks "Confirm Cash" button
   - System records GPS location automatically
   - Payment recorded in database
   - Subscription activated immediately
   - Invoice marked as paid
   - Resident gets notification
   - Success message: "‚Ç±199 recorded. Subscription activated!"

   **Option B: Resident Doesn't Pay**
   - Collector clicks "‚ö†Ô∏è Payment Failed" button
   - System shows 4 options:
     * Resident Not Home
     * Resident Has No Cash
     * Resident Refused to Pay
     * Promised to Pay Next Time
   - System records failed attempt with GPS location
   - Retry automatically scheduled for next day
   - Payment score decreases
   - After 3 failed attempts ‚Üí Subscription auto-suspended

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Changes

### **New Table: `payment_attempts`**
Tracks every payment collection attempt:
```sql
- attempt_id (Primary Key)
- subscription_id
- user_id
- collector_id
- outcome (paid, not_home, refused, etc.)
- amount_collected
- location_lat, location_lng (GPS verification)
- notes
- retry_scheduled_date
- created_at
```

### **Enhanced Tables:**

**`customer_subscriptions`** - Added columns:
- `payment_attempts_count` - How many times collector tried
- `last_payment_attempt_date` - When was last attempt
- `payment_score` - Reliability score (0-100)
- `requires_prepayment` - Flag for bad payers
- `suspension_reason` - Why suspended
- `suspended_at` - When suspended

**`users`** - Added columns:
- `payment_reliability_score` - Overall payment history
- `total_payments_made` - Successful payments
- `total_payments_failed` - Failed attempts
- `consecutive_failed_attempts` - Current streak

---

## üîÑ How The System Works

### **Payment Scoring System:**

**Successful Payment (+10 points):**
- Score increases
- Consecutive failures reset to 0
- Good standing maintained

**Minor Failure (-5 points):**
- Not home
- No cash available
- Promised next time

**Major Failure (-15 points):**
- Refused to pay
- Disputed payment
- Cancelled subscription

**Score Ranges:**
- 90-100: Excellent (Green badge)
- 70-89: Good (Blue badge)
- 50-69: Fair (Yellow badge)
- Below 50: Poor (Red badge - requires prepayment)

### **Three-Strike Auto-Suspension:**

**Automatic Triggers:**
```javascript
Strike 1: Failed attempt recorded, retry tomorrow
Strike 2: Warning notification sent, retry in 2 days
Strike 3: Subscription SUSPENDED automatically
```

**Database Trigger:**
- Monitors failed attempts in last 10 days
- If 3+ failures detected ‚Üí Auto-suspend
- Suspension reason recorded
- Timestamp logged

## üéÆ How To Use (Collector Instructions)

### **Scenario 1: Resident Pays Successfully**

1. Arrive at resident's house
2. Collect waste
3. Ask for payment (‚Ç±199)
4. In app:
   - Amount field shows ‚Ç±199
   - Click "Confirm Cash"
   - Wait for success message
5. Done! Subscription activated

### **Scenario 2: Resident Not Available**

1. Arrive at house
2. No one home
3. In app:
   - Click "‚ö†Ô∏è Payment Failed"
   - Select "Resident Not Home"
4. System schedules retry for tomorrow
5. Resident gets notification

### **Scenario 3: Resident Refuses**

1. Arrive at house
2. Resident refuses to pay
3. In app:
   - Click "‚ö†Ô∏è Payment Failed"
   - Select "Resident Refused to Pay"
4. System records serious failure
5. After 3 refusals ‚Üí Auto-suspended

---

## üìä What Happens Behind The Scenes

### **When Payment Succeeds:**
```
1. Payment attempt recorded with outcome='paid'
2. GPS location saved
3. Subscription status ‚Üí 'active'
4. Payment status ‚Üí 'paid'
5. Invoice status ‚Üí 'paid'
6. Payment record created
7. User payment score +10
8. Notifications sent
9. Collector sees success message
```

### **When Payment Fails:**
```
1. Payment attempt recorded with outcome='not_home' (or other)
2. GPS location saved
3. Retry scheduled for tomorrow
4. User payment score -5 or -15
5. Attempt counter incremented
6. If attempts >= 3:
   - Subscription ‚Üí 'suspended'
   - Service stopped
   - Suspension notification sent
7. Collector sees warning if 2+ attempts
```

---

## üöÄ Next Steps To Complete Implementation

### **Phase 1: Database Setup (Do This First!)**

```bash
# Run the SQL schema file
psql -U your_username -d your_database -f backend/database/payment_attempts_schema.sql
```

This creates:
- `payment_attempts` table
- Automatic triggers
- Score calculation functions
- Analytics views

### **Phase 2: Test The Flow**

1. **Test Successful Payment:**
   - Create subscription with cash payment
   - Have collector confirm payment
   - Verify subscription activated
   - Check payment_attempts table

2. **Test Failed Payment:**
   - Create subscription
   - Click "Payment Failed" ‚Üí "Not Home"
   - Verify attempt recorded
   - Check payment score decreased

3. **Test Auto-Suspension:**
   - Record 3 failed attempts
   - Verify subscription suspended
   - Check suspension_reason field

### **Phase 3: Add Notifications (Recommended)**

Create notification service for:
- Reminder before collection day
- Failed attempt notification to resident
- Suspension warning (after 2 attempts)
- Suspension notification
- Reactivation instructions

### **Phase 4: Admin Dashboard (Optional)**

Add admin views for:
- Payment attempt analytics
- Collector performance metrics
- Suspended subscriptions list
- Payment score distribution
- Failed attempt trends

---

## üîç Monitoring & Analytics

### **Available Analytics Views:**

**`payment_attempt_analytics`** - Per user/subscription:
- Total attempts
- Success rate
- Total collected
- Payment score
- Last attempt date

**`collector_payment_performance`** - Per collector:
- Collection rate
- Total amount collected
- Failed collections
- Unique residents served

### **Query Examples:**

```sql
-- Find residents with low payment scores
SELECT * FROM payment_attempt_analytics 
WHERE payment_score < 50 
ORDER BY payment_score ASC;

-- Find best performing collectors
SELECT * FROM collector_payment_performance 
WHERE collection_rate > 85 
ORDER BY collection_rate DESC;

-- Find subscriptions needing attention
SELECT * FROM customer_subscriptions 
WHERE payment_attempts_count >= 2 
  AND status = 'pending_payment';
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### **GPS Location Tracking:**
- Automatically captured during payment confirmation
- Used for dispute resolution
- Optional (system works without it)
- Requires location permissions in app

### **Payment Score Impact:**
- Affects service priority
- Below 50 ‚Üí Requires prepayment
- Visible to admin only
- Can be reset by admin

### **Auto-Suspension:**
- Happens after 3 failed attempts in 10 days
- Can be manually reactivated by admin
- Resident must pay to reactivate
- Clear suspension reason recorded

### **Retry Scheduling:**
- Automatic next-day retry
- No manual scheduling needed
- Collector sees in next day's route
- Up to 3 automatic retries

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

**Issue: Payment confirmed but subscription not activated**
