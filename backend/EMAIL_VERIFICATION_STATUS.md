### 3. **Step 1 Email Verification** ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE FOUND

**Problem:** Temporary tokens are being lost between step 1 verification and registration

**Current Behavior:**
- User verifies email in step 1 ‚úÖ
- Temporary token stored in `global.tempVerificationTokens` ‚úÖ
- User proceeds to registration
- System doesn't find the temporary token ‚ùå
- Sends another verification email ‚ùå

**Root Cause:** 
- Server restart clears `global.tempVerificationTokens` (in-memory storage)
- Tokens may expire or be cleared
- No persistence between step 1 and registration

**Debug Logging Added:**
```javascript
üîç Checking step 1 verification for: markiews27@gmail.com
üîç Total temp tokens: 0
üîç Temp data exists: false
üîç Is verified: false
```

---

## üîß RECOMMENDED FIXES

### Option 1: Store Verification in Database (Recommended)
Instead of in-memory storage, store step 1 verification in database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE email_verifications (
  email VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  token VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Option 2: Skip Step 1 Verification Entirely
Set all new registrations to `email_verified = true` and rely only on admin approval:

```javascript
// In registration
isTempVerified = true; // Always true
shouldSendEmail = false; // Never send verification email
```

### Option 3: Extend Token Expiration
Increase token expiration from 24 hours to longer period and persist across server restarts.
